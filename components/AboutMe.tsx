      <p>
        Hi my name is Karim! I am an Early Entry student and a senior at UNC Charlotte, currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. Iâ€™m very passionate about technology in general, and I love learning new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current favorite languages are Java, C++, Javascript, and Typescript. I always love learning programming languages and using them to solve complex problems. My overall goal is to become a software engineer or a cloud engineer, and hopefully my education and skills will contribute to cutting-edge solutions in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream job is to secure a sustainable remote job, as I love the idea of working at home. For what I like to do in general besides coding is go to the gym, play basketball, and play video games.
      </p>
